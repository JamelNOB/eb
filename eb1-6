Electronic Commerce (2)

•	Easier-to-sell products using E-commerce have:
–	Strong brand reputation (e.g., jewelry)
–	Appeal to small but geographically diverse groups (e.g., collectible comic books)

•	Costs include:
–	Brokerage fees and sales commissions
–	Cost of information search and acquisition
–	Investment a seller makes in equipment or hiring of skilled employees
•	Sweater dealer example (Figure 1-6)
 
 
FIGURE 1-6 Market form of economic organization
 
Markets and Hierarchies (1)


•	Coase’s analysis of high transaction costs
–	Hierarchical organizations replace market-negotiated transactions, which include
–	Strong supervision and worker-monitoring elements
–	Vertical integration sweater example (Figure 1-7)
–	Vertical integration: the practice of an existing firm replacing its supplier markets with its own hierarchical structure for creating the supplied product
 
Markets and Hierarchies (2)


•	Oliver Williamson (extended Coase’s analysis)
–	Firms with complex manufacturing and assembly operations
•	Tend to be hierarchically organized, vertically integrated
–	Manufacturing innovations increased hierarchical monitoring activities’ efficiency and effectiveness
 
 
FIGURE 1-7 Hierarchical form of economic organization
 
Markets and Hierarchies (3)


•	Strategic business unit (business unit)
•	Organizations become too large to keep track of the operational activities effectively at the lowest level of the firm
•	Decentralization is a must
–	An autonomous part of a company
–	Large enough to manage itself
–	Small enough to quickly respond to business environment changes
 
Using Electronic Commerce to Reduce
Transaction Costs (1)

•	Electronic commerce can
–	Improve flow of information and increase coordination of actions
–	Reducing the cost of searching for potential buyers and sellers and increasing the number of potential market participants. Thus change attractiveness of vertical integration
 
Using Electronic Commerce to Reduce
Transaction Costs (2)

•	Example: employment transaction
–	Telecommuting reduces or eliminates transaction costs for the seller (employee), include:
–	Learning and adapting to the culture of new employers
–	House moving, loss of a spouse’s job
–	…
 
Network Economic Structures


•	Neither market nor hierarchy
•	Strategic alliances (strategic partnerships)
–	Companies coordinate strategies, resources, skill sets by forming long-term stable relationships with other companies and individuals based on shared purposes
–	Strategic partners come together for specific projects or activities
 
Network Economic Structures


•	Network organizations are well suited to information- intensive technology industries
–	Electronic commerce makes networks easier to construct and maintain
–	Castells predicts economic networks will become the organizing structure for social interactions
 
 
FIGURE 1-8 Network form of economic organization
 
Network Effects



•	Law of diminishing returns
–	Activities yield less value as consumption amount increases
•	Example: hamburger consumption
•	Network effect
–	Exception to law of diminishing returns
–	As more people or organizations participate in network, the value to each participant increases
–	This increase in value is called a network effect
–	Examples: Landline phones, e-mail
 
Identifying Electronic Commerce Opportunities



•	Focus on specific business processes
–	Break business down
–	Series of value-adding activities that combine to make profits and meet firm’s goals
•	Business activities conducted by firms of all sizes
•	Firm
–	Multiple business units owned by a common set of shareholders

•	Strategic business unit primary activities
–	Design, identify customers, purchase materials and supplies, manufacture product or create service, market and sell, deliver, provide after-sale service and supporting activities
 
Strategic Business Unit Value Chains (2)



•	Importance of primary activities depends on:
–	Product or service the business unit provides
–	Customers to which it sells
•	Central corporate organization typically provides support activities
–	Finance and administration
–	Human resource
–	Technology development
 
 
FIGURE 1-9 Value chain for a strategic business unit
 
Industry Value Chains

•	Porter’s value system
–	Describes larger activities’ stream into which a particular
business unit’s value chain is embedded
–	Industry value chain refers to value systems
•	Awareness of businesses value chain activities
–	Allows identification of new opportunities for cost reduction, product improvement, or channel reconfiguration
–	 Useful way to think about general business strategy	
 
 

FIGURE 1-10 Industry value chain for a strategic business unit
 
SWOT Analysis: Evaluating Business

Stock Brokerage Firms:
Two Rounds of Disintermediation
   
•	Original full-line brokers charged relatively high commissions (for each trade executed) and provided free advice

	played as apps on mobile devices	
 
Fee-for-Service Revenue Models –
Professional Services

Free for Many, Fee for a Few

•	Economics of manufacturing and selling
•	Physical and digital products are different
•	Unit cost high percentage of physical products
•	Large up-front cost yet unit cost very small for digital products
•	Leads to a different revenue model
•	Offer basic product to many for free
•	Charge a fee to a small number for differentiated products
•	Examples: Yahoo e-mail accounts
•	Inverse logic applied to physical products: free samples to entice sales (cookie samples)
 
Changing Strategies:
Revenue Models in Transition

•	Companies must change revenue model to meet needs of new and changing Web users
•	Some companies created e-commerce Web sites
– Needed many years to grow large enough to become profitable (CNN and ESPN)
•	Some companies changed model or went out of business
•	Case studies of strategies that evolved from experience and adaptations to change
 
Subscription to Advertising-Supported Model


•	Slate magazine (founded by Microsoft) started as an upscale news and current events site
•	Success expectations were high
– Experienced writers and editors
•	Begin charging an annual subscription fee after a limited free introductory period
–	Subscription fees did not cover operating costs
–	Now an advertising-supported site and part of the Bing portal
•	Likely value to Microsoft is increase to the portal’s stickiness
 
Advertising-Supported to
Advertising-Subscription Mixed Model

•	Online magazine Salon.com
– Acclaimed for innovative content
•	Initially operated as an advertising-supported site
•	Now offers optional subscription version
–	Motivated by the inability to raise the additional money from investors

–	Britannica Internet Guide was free
–	Encyclopedia Britannica Online has a subscription fee or was offered as part of the CD package
–	Subscription fees were low
•	Converted to free advertiser-supported site (1999)
–	Advertising revenues insufficient to generate profit
•	The main value to sell is its reputation and the expertise of its editors, contributors, and advisors
•	Returned to mixed model in 2001
–	Subscriptions are the major revenue source with
	additional revenue from online product store sales	
 
Multiple Changes to Revenue Models
(Cont’d.)

•	New York Times Web site started as the mid 1990’s as purely
advertising supported
–	Subscription fee for premium crosswords, chess column and archived articles
•	2005: Additional content required subscription
–	Required subscription for most desirable content, Op Ed and news columns
–	Brought in about 227,000 subscribers, $10 million in revenue
•	2007: Return to advertising-supported free access
–	The traffic to the site doubled
–	The recession of 2008 caused the advertising revenue to drop
 
Multiple Changes to Revenue Models
(Cont’d.)

–	Reduced the number of free articles allowed to
nonsubscribers to 10 per month
–	Hope mixed revenue model will provide acceptable balance between print and online to keep the newspaper operating
 
Channel Conflict and Cannibalization

•	Concerns that Web sales activities will take away sales from existing
outlets and networks
•	In 2000 Levi stopped selling products online because of channel conflict and cannibalization
–	Cannibalization: because the Web site’s sales consume sales that would be made
in the company’s other sales channels
–	Have started online sales again due to agreement that Web sales are insignificant
–	Provides Store Locator Links for those who prefer to shop in person
–	Retailers opened online stores themselves: less threat
 
Channel Conflict and Cannibalization
(cont’d.)

•	Reason: the company has established sales channels that would compete with direct sales on the company’s own Web site
•	Eddie Bauer was selling through catalogs and retail stores when it started selling on the Web
–	Online purchases returnable at retail stores
–	Required manager compensation and bonus plans adjustments to support
Web site
•	Retail managers credited for each Web site return (additional allowance)
•	Catalog managers credited for existing customers who purchased through Web site
•	Overall sales increased through the coordinated efforts
–	Channel cooperation made it successful
 
Strategic Alliances

•	Two or more companies join forces to undertake an activity over long time period
–	Relationship Levi’s created with retail partners
•	Amazon.com has formed several strategic alliances
–	Target to sell clothing
–	CDnow to sell music CDs
–	Many smaller companies to offer their products for sale on the Amazon Web site
 
Luxury Goods Strategies

•	Products can be difficult to sell online
–	Customers want to see product in person or touch
–	Brands hesitated selling online for fear of alienating upscale physical stores that sold products
•	Some sites limit online offerings
–	Chanel only offers fragrance and skincare only (no clothing line)
–	Calvin Klein only sells ready-to-wear on Web site (no couture line)
•	Jewelry sales have grown rapidly in recent years
–	Blue Nile, Ice.com, and Costco are successful due to availability of independent appraisal certificates and	“No questions asked” return
	policies	
 
Overstock Sales Strategies

•	Selling overstock items as clearance specials on Web sites have allowed retailers like Lands’ End to close some of its physical outlet stores
•	Many retail Web sites include link to separate sections for overstock or clearance items
•	Online store reaches more people than a physical store with frequent updates possible
•	Websites such as Overstock.com are devoted entirely to the sale of overstocked items purchased from other retailers

CHAPTER FOUR
Marketing on the Web

 
Introduction

•	When household products were purchased primarily by women, ads depicting the father as inept might have made sense
•	Men now take a larger role in these decisions and companies have turned away from adverting that makes a joke of men’s experiences
•	In 2012 Kimberly-Clark faced a firestorm of criticism for portraying men as incompetent caregivers
– Company now regularly engages with “dad-focused” social media outlets and participates in the annual Dad 2.0 Summit, a conference focusing on advising companies on how to appeal to fathers
 
In This Chapter

You will learn:
	How companies use advertising and marketing to develop long-term relationships with customers that might never meet in person
	It is important to tell an authentic, accurate, meaningful, and consistent story through both online and physical channels
	This underlines the principles of branding, marketing, relationship management, and communication that you will learn about in this chapter
 
The Four Ps of Marketing (1/2)

Essential issues of marketing are organized into four Ps of marketing:
•	Product is the physical item or service that a company is selling
•	Brand is the customers’ perception of the product
•	Brand can be as important as the actual characteristics of the product
•	Price is amount customer pays for the product
 
The Four Ps of Marketing (2/2)

•	Promotion includes any means to spread the word about the product
•	Place (distribution) is the need to have products or services available in many different locations
•	The problem of getting right products to the right places at the best time to sell them
•	The internet can help
•	Digital products can be delivered almost instantly
•	Internet provides much better shipment tracking and inventory control tools
 
Product-Based Marketing Strategies

•	Managers often think of their business in terms of products and services sold
–	Works well when customers want to buy items from particular product categories, or think of needs in terms of product categories
•	Web site examples: Office Depot, Staples, Sears
•	Not an efficient Web site design when customers look to fulfill a specific need instead of a specific product
–	E.g., redecorating a room or choosing a graduation gift
–	Design Web site to meet individual customer needs
–	Need to offer alternative shopping paths to meet the above requiement
 
Customer-Based Marketing Strategies

•	Web sites designed to meet various types of customers’ specific needs
–	Initial step is to identify customer groups sharing common characteristics (such group is called demographic)
–	Make site more accessible and useful for each group
•	Companies need to take view beyond internal perspective
–	Early university Web sites were designed around the internal elements such as departments, colleges, and programs
–	Current university Web sites focus design on needs of stakeholders (current students, prospective students, parents of students, potential donors, faculty)
 
Communicating with Different Market Segments

•	An equally important component of any market strategy is the selection of communication media to carry the marketing message
•	Media selection or choosing where to market and advertise a company can be critical for an on-line only firm
–	No physical presence
–	Only contact a customer might have with an online firm is the image projected through media and Web site
•	Online firm challenge is to obtain customer trust with no physical presence
 
Trust, Complexity, and Media Choice
•	The Web is a very broad, intermediate step between mass media and personal contact
•	Web communication offers elements of mass media messaging, personal contact interaction, and anything in between
–	Mass media advertising offers lowest trust level but its low cost
per viewer makes it attractive to many companies
•	Product complexity is a factor in media choice
•	Many companies use blogs to communicate
–	Blogs and social media allow companies to engage in two-way communications that more like the high-trust personal contact communication mode without incurring high cost
 
 
FIGURE 4-2 Trust in three communication modes
 
Market Segmentation

•	Market segmentation: divides potential customer pool into segments defined by customer characteristics
–	A way to deal with the decrease in advertisement effectiveness
•	Micromarketing is the practice of targeting very small market segments
–	Hampered by much higher “low cost per viewer”
•	Three categories to identify market segments
–	Geographic segmentation (e.g., location)
–	Demographic segmentation (e.g., age, gender, family size, income)
–	Psychographic segmentation (e.g., social class, personality)
•	  Television advertisers use all three categories	
 


 

FIGURE 4-3 Television advertising messages tailored to program audience
 
Market Segmentation on the Web

•	Web presents an opportunity for different store environments online
–	Juicy Couture site targets young, fashion-conscious buyers
–	A wide variety of typefaces, bold graphics, brightly colored products
–	Talbots site targets older, more established buyers
–	More subtle, conservative style
•	Retail stores have limited floor and display space
–	Must convey one particular message
•	Web stores can provide separate virtual spaces for different market segments
–	One-to-one marketing offers products and services matched to needs of a particular customer
 
Beyond Market Segmentation

We have learned:
	How companies can target as market segments groups of customers that share common characteristics
The next step:
	Beyond market segmentation
	Even beyond one-to-one marketing
	Is when companies use the Web to target specific customers in different ways at different times
 
Segmentation Using Customer Behavior
•	Same person requires different combinations of products and services depending on the occasion
•	Behavioral segmentation is the creation of separate experiences for customers based on behavior
•	Much easier in the online world to design a single Web site that meets the needs of visitors in different behavioral modes
–	Customizing visitor experiences to match site usage behavior patterns of each visitor type is usage-based market segmentation
–	One popular set of categories include browsers, buyer, and shoppers
 
Browsers

•	Some visitors just surf or browse sites
•	Web site must offer something to stimulate visitors’
interest
–	Trigger words, links to explanations or instructions, extra content related to products and services
–	Visitors who develop a favorable impression are more likely to buy or bookmark site for a return visit
 
Buyers

•	Ready to make a purchase right away
•	Site should offer a direct route into purchase transaction
	Shopping cart is the part of the Web site that keeps track of items selected for purchase and automates purchasing process
•	Primary goal is to get buyer to shopping cart as quickly as possible
 
Shoppers

•	Motivated to buy but looking for more information before purchase (the customer knows the site offers items they are interested in buying)
•	Site should offer comparison tools, product reviews, and features lists
•	Person may visit a Web site one day as a browser and return later as a shopper or buyer
–	People do not retain behavioral categories from one visit to the
next even for the same Web site
 
 
FIGURE 4-4 Web site visitor categories based on a behavioral segmentation study
 
Customer Relationship Intensity and Life-Cycle Segmentation
•	One-to-one marketing and usage-based segmentation strengthen companies’ relationships with customers
•	Good customer experiences create feelings of intense loyalty
•	Typical five-stage model of customer loyalty
–	Awareness, Exploration, Familiarity, Commitment,
Separation
–	First four stages show increase in relationship intensity
–	In the fifth stage, decline occurs and the relationship terminates
 


 


FIGURE 4-5 Five stages of customer loyalty
 
Customer Relationship Intensity and Life-Cycle Segmentation (cont’d.)

•	Characteristics of the five stages
–	Awareness: customers recognize company name or one of its product (in the awareness stage)
–	Exploration: customers learn more about company, products (extensive information interchange)
–	Familiarity:
•	Customers have completed several transactions
•	Customers aware of returns and credits policies
•	Customers aware of pricing flexibility
•	Customers just as likely to shop competitors
 
Customer Relationship Intensity and Life-Cycle Segmentation (cont’d.)

•	Characteristics of the five stages (cont’d.)
–	Commitment
•	Customers experience highly satisfactory encounters
•	Customers develop fierce loyalty or strong preference
–	Separation
•	Conditions that made relationship valuable change
•	Parties enter separation stage
•	Goal is to move customers into the commitment stage as quickly as possible and keep them there as long as possible
•	Only want to see customers move into the separation stage if they are costing more to serve than they are worth
 
Customer Acquisition: The Funnel Model
•	Conceptual tool used to understand the overall nature of a marketing strategy
–	But also provides a clear structure for evaluating specific strategy elements
•	Similar to customer life-cycle model but less abstract
–	Better job at showing effectiveness of two or more specific strategies
 
 

FIGURE 4-6 Funnel model of customer acquisition
 
Costs of Customer Acquisition, Conversion, and Retention
•	Benefits of acquiring new visitors are different for Web businesses
with different revenue models
•	Acquisition cost is the amount of money spent to bring one customer to the site
•	Conversion is converting a visitor into a customer
–	Conversion cost is the total amount of money a site spends to induce a visitor to purchase, subscribe or register
•	Retained customers return to site after purchase
–	Retention cost is the cost of inducing customers to return to a
Web site and buy again
 
Advertising on the Web

•	Can use five-stage customer loyalty model
–	Awareness stage: message should inform
–	Exploration stage: message should explain how product works and encourage switching brands
–	Familiarity stage: message should (be persuasive) convince
customers to purchase products or request a salesperson call
–	Commitment stage: message should reinforce customers’ good
feelings about the brand and remind them to buy
–	Separation stage customers NOT targeted in ads
•	Online ads should be coordinated with existing advertising efforts
 
Display Ads

•	Display ads: small rectangular object with stationary or moving graphic (also called banner ads)
•	Includes hyperlink to advertiser’s Web site
–	Is versatile: including informative and persuasive functions
•	From a simple picture to attention-grabbing ads include audio and video (created using Shockwave, Java, Flash)
•	Interactive marketing unit (IMU) ad formats
–	The standard display ad sizes that most Web sites have
voluntarily agreed to use
 
Display Ads (cont’d.)

Four standard formats are encouraged to used:
•	Leaderboard ad is designed to span Web page top or bottom
•	Skyscraper ad is designed to be placed on the side of a Web page
–	Remains visible as user scrolls through page
•	Two sizes of rectangle ads
•	Advertising agencies and web site design firms create display ads for online clients
–	Price range $50 to more than $8000 depending on complexity
 
 
FIGURE 4-7 Interactive Advertising Bureau Universal Ad Package format standards
 
Intrusive Ad Formats

•	Pop-up ad appears in its own window when user opens/closes Web page and require the user to click a small close button (difficult to find) in the window of the ad
–	Annoying and may create lasting bad will, but many advertisers find them to be effective
•	Ad-blocking software prevents display ads and pop-up ads from loading
•	Interstitial ads open in their own browser page when a user clicks to load a page
–	May close automatically or require user to close
	– Larger and more annoying than pop-up ads	
 
Rich Media and Video Ad Formats

•	Generate graphical activity that “floats” over the Web page itself
(instead of a new window)
–	Always contain moving graphics and usually include audio and video elements (compared with the pictures provided by display ads)
•	Video ads are a form of rich media ad used on Web sites that deliver
video
–	Either free standing or integrated into videos that the site visitor selects to watch
–	A pre-roll video ad requires a visitor to view all or part of an ad at the beginning of
the clip
–	Most video ads are 10 to 30 seconds long
–	Becoming more important as in increasing number of people are watching video entertainment online.
 
Text Ads

•	Short promotional message with no graphic elements
–	Usually placed along Web page top or right side
•	Google found these ads to be less obtrusive than display ads but very effective
–	Criticized for including too unobtrusive ads on its pages
–	Difficult to distinguish the paid ads from the search results
–	Google now clearly labels ads to prevent confusion
•	Inline text ad are text in stories displayed as hyperlinks
–	Used by newspapers, magazine, etc. to prompt users to visit to learn more about a topic
 
Text Ads – Google example



 
Mobile Device Advertising

•	Tremendous usage growth for mobile devices connected to Internet
•	Some mobile software applications (mobile apps) include advertising element
–	Messages displayed from advertisers
–	Appear on a part of the app screen or in a separate screen
–	Advertising space on mobile apps is sold in the same way as that on Web sites
–	One of the fastest-growing types of online promotion
 
Site Sponsorships

•	Web sites offer advertisers opportunity to sponsor all (or parts) of their sites
•	Give advertisers a chance to promote their products in a more subtle way compared with display or pop-up ads
•	Goals similar to sporting event sponsors, television program sponsors
–	Tie company (product) name to an event (set of information)
•	Ethical concerns raised if sponsor allowed to create content or weave advertising into site’s content
–	Should always be clearly identified as advertisement or as provided
	by the sponsor	
 
Online Advertising Cost and Effectiveness
•	Issue of measuring Web site effectiveness has become important
•	Pricing metric is cost per thousand (CPM) for mass media advertising
–	“M” from Roman numeral for “thousand”
–	Dollar amount paid for every thousand people in the estimated audience
•	Cost per click (CPC) is an alternative to CPM for online advertising
–	Charge is for click


 
Online Advertising Cost and Effectiveness (cont’d.)
•	A visit occurs when a visitor requests a page from a Web site
–	Trial visit is the first time a particular visitor loads a Web site page
–	Repeat visit is subsequent page loads
•	Each page loaded by visitor counts as a page view
–	If page contains an ad, called an ad view
•	Some Web pages have display ads that continue to load and reload as long as the page is open
–	Each time the display ad loads is an impression
–	If visitor clicks the display ad, action is a click or click-
	through	
 
 
FIGURE 4-10 CPM rates for advertising in various media
 
Online Advertising Cost and Effectiveness (cont’d.)
•	Difficult for companies to gauge the cost and benefits of advertising on the Web
•	Many have developed new metrics to evaluate the number of desired outcomes advertising yields
–	Instead of CPM or CPC, they measure the number of new visitors to their site who buy for the first time after arriving by way of a click- through
–	Then they calculate the advertising cost of acquiring one customer on the Web, and do comparison with traditional ways
•	Most analysts agree that online advertising is much more effective if properly targeted
 
E-Mail Marketing

•	Online ads can reach site visitors who are looking for something specific
•	This makes online ads more successful than ads viewed by a general population
•	Market segmentation is therefore an important element in online advertising process
•	One useful marketing tool that uses market segmentation effectively is e-mail marketing
–	Used to announce new products or features
–	Used to announce sales on existing products
 
Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE, Spam)
•	Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE, Spam, bulk mail) is electronic junk mail
–	Includes solicitations, ads or e-mail chain letters
–	Wastes time, disk space, and consumes large amounts of Internet capacity
•	Key element to in any e-mail strategy
–	Obtain customer approval prior to sending
 
Permission Marketing

•	Conversion rate is the percentage of recipients responding to an ad or promotion
–	Ranges from 10% to more than 30% on requested e-mail messages
–	Higher than click-through rates on display ads (<0.5% and decreasing)
•	Opt-in e-mail is the practice of sending e-mail messages to people who request information
–	Part of permission marketing strategy
–	More successful than the strategy of sending general promotional messages through the mass media
–	Example companies: ConstantContact, Yesmail, Return Path
 
Combining Content and Advertising

•	Combine useful content (articles, news stories of interest) with an advertising e-mail message can increases acceptance of e-mail
•	Advertising e-mail message is hyperlinks instead of large attachments
–	Takes customers to advertiser’s Web site content
–	Easier to induce customer to stay on the site and consider making purchases
•	Coordination across media outlets is an important element in any marketing strategy
–	Other marketing efforts undertaken at the same time should
 
Technology-Enabled Customer Relationship Management
•	Clickstream is the information that a Web site can gather about its visitors, e.g., which pages were viewed, how long each page was viewed, the sequence, etc.
•	Technology-enabled relationship management occurs when firm obtains information on customer behavior, preferences, needs and buying patterns, and uses them to
–	Set prices, negotiate terms, tailor promotions, add product features, customize customer relationship
–	Also called Customer Relationship Management (CRM), technology-enabled customer relationship management or electronic Customer Relationship Management (eCRM)
 
CRM as a Source of Value

•	Good CRM systems gather information from every customer touchpoint
•	Multiple sources of information about customers is entered into a large database called a data warehouse
	Data mining is a process with well-understood stages based on
	application of information technology
	analyst's creativity
	business knowledge
	common sense
 

Example 1: Hurricane Frances (1/2)

Hurricane Frances was on its way, barreling across the Caribbean, threatening a direct hit on Florida’s Atlantic coast. Residents madefor higher ground, but far away, in Bentonville, Ark., executives at Wal- Mart Stores decided that the situation offered a great opportunity for one of their newest data-driven weapons ... predictive technology.
A week ahead of the storm’s landfall, Linda M. Dillman, Wal-Mart’s chief information officer, pressed her staff to come up with forecasts based on what had happened when Hurricane Charley struck several weeks earlier. Backed by the trillions of bytes’ worth of shopper history that is stored in Wal-Mart’s data warehouse, she felt that the company could ‘start predicting what’s going to happen, instead of waiting for it to happen,’ as she put it. (Hays, New York Times, 2004)
 
Example 1: Hurricane Frances (2/2)

	Why might data-driven prediction be useful?
	Bottled water, or flashlights?
	A particular DVD sold out?
	Discover sales patterns due to the hurricane that are NOT obvious!
	Identify unusual local demand for products
 	 
 
Example 2: Predicting customer churn (1)


	Many cellphone companies have major problems with customer retention
	Cellphone market is saturated
	Churn: customers switching from one company to another, which is expensive for companies
	Task: keep your customers by predicting who should get a retention offer
 
Example 2: Predicting customer churn (2)


	What data you might use?

	How would they be used?


	How should the company choose a set of customers to receive their offer in order to best reduce churn for a particular incentive budget?
 
From Business Problems to Data Mining Tasks

From business problems to data mining


	Decompose a data analytics problem into pieces such that you can solve a known task with a tool
	There is a large number of data mining algorithms available, but only a limited number of data mining tasks
	We will illustrate the fundamental concepts based on
	Classification
	Regression
 

Classification
 
From Business Problems to Data Mining Tasks
 

   
	Classification attempts to predict, for each individual in a population, which of a (small) set of classes that individual belongs to
	E.g., “Among all the customers of a cellphone company, which are likely to
correspond to a given offer?”
	Classification algorithms provide models that determine which class a new individual belongs to
	Classification is related to scoring or class probability estimation
 

Regression
 
From Business Problems to Data Mining Tasks
 

   
	Regression (value estimation) attempts to estimate or predict, for each individual, the numerical value for that individual
	E.g., “How much will a given customer use the service?”
Predicted variable: service usage
	Generate regression model by looking at other, similar individuals in the population
 

Similarity Matching
 
From Business Problems to Data Mining Tasks
 

   
	Similarity matching attempts to identify similar individuals based on the data known about the individuals
	Find similar entities
	Basis for making product recommendations
	E.g., “Find people who are similar to you in
terms of the products they have liked or
purchased”
	Similarity measures underlie certain solutions to other data mining tasks
 

Clustering
 
From Business Problems to Data Mining Tasks
 

   
	Clustering attempts to group individuals in a population together by their similarity, but without regard to any specific purpose
	E.g., “Do customers form natural groups or segments?”
Result: groupings of the individuals of a population
	Useful in preliminary domain exploration
 
From Business Problems to Data Mining Tasks

Co-Occurrence Grouping

	Attempts to find associations between entities based on transactions involving them
	Aka association rules or market-basket analysis
	E.g., “What items are commonly purchased together?”
	Considers similarity of objects based on their appearing together in transactions (compared with clustering)
	Included in recommendation systems (people who
 

Profiling
 
From Business Problems to Data Mining Tasks
 

   
	Attempts to characterize the typical behavior of a group or
population
	Aka behavior description
	E.g., “What is the typical cellphone usage of this customer segment?”
	Often used to establish behavioral norms for anomaly detection (fraud detection)
 
From Business Problems to Data Mining Tasks

Some More Data Mining Tasks

	Link prediction attempts to predict connections between data items (social network systems)
	E.g., “Since you and Karen share ten friends, maybe you‘d like to be Karen‘s friend?”


	Data reduction attempts to take a large data set of data and replace it with a smaller set of data that contains the relevant information
	Easier processing, but often loss of information
 
Creating and Maintaining Brands on the Web
•	Branded products easier to advertise and promote
–	Each product carries reputation of the brand name
–	Value far exceeds cost of creating them
•	Three key brand elements
–	Product differentiation clearly distinguishes product
–	Relevance is degree to which product offers utility to a potential customer
–	Perceived value (key element) occurs when customer perceives a value in buying product
•	Environmental changes cause brands to lose value
 
 

FIGURE 4-13 Elements of a brand
 
Emotional Branding vs. Rational Branding
•	Emotional branding use emotional appeals in their advertising to establish and maintain brands
–	Works well on television, radio, billboards and print
–	Ad targets in passive information acceptance mode
–	Difficult to convey on Web which is an active medium
controlled by customer
•	Rational branding offers to help Web users in some way in exchange for viewing an ad
–	Relies on cognitive appeal of specific help offered, instead of a broad emotional appeal
 
Viral Marketing Strategies and Social Media
•	Viral marketing relies on existing customers to tell prospective customers about products or service
•	Social media marketing is best done using an indirect approach
–	People do not use social media to shop, they use social
media to socialize
–	Encourage community to discuss the desirability of a product or service, instead of telling them that it has something to sell
–	Web site followers on a company’s discussion activity are called fans (metric of assessing the success or not)

–	Managing spend is an important function and can be a key component in overall profitability
 










FIGURE 5-1 Steps in a typical
business purchasing process









CHAPTER 5: Business-to-Business Activities	7
 
Direct vs. Indirect Materials Purchasing
•	Direct materials are those materials that become part of the finished product in a manufacturing process. E.g., iron ore for Steel manufacturer
•	Direct materials purchasing
•	Replenishment purchasing (contract purchasing)
•	Company negotiates long-term material contracts
•	Spot purchasing
•	Purchases made in loosely organized (spot) market
•	If demand exceeds contract purchasing estimates
•	Indirect materials are all other materials company purchases
•	Includes factory supplies such as sandpaper, hand tools and replacement parts for machinery
 
Logistics Activities

•	Classic objective is to provide the right goods in the right quantities in the right place at the right time
•	Managing materials, supplies and finished goods
–	Web and the Internet providing increasing number of opportunities to better manage activities
–	Lower transaction costs and constant connectivity between firms
•	Marriage of GPS and portable computing with the Internet is an example of second-wave e-commerce
•	Third-wave e-commerce supported by smart phones
 
Business Process Support Activities

•	Supporting activities including: finance and administration, human resources (HR), technology development
–	Human resources, payroll, retirement plan servicing often outsourced by small/midsized companies
•	Common support activity is training
–	May be handled by HR or individual departments
 
 


FIGURE 5-2 Categories of support activities
 
E-Government

•	Use of Internet technologies by governments and government agencies
–	Enhances functions performed for stakeholders and businesslike activity operations
–	U.S. government Financial Management Service (FMS)
uses Pay.gov to handle activity
–	Bureau of Public Debt: TreasuryDirect site
–	Also used in other countries
•	U.S. states and cities usually have sites
–	Information about laws and regulations, licenses, jobs, tourism and more

Network Model of Economic Organization in Purchasing: Supply Webs

•	Trend in purchasing, logistics, and support activities is the shift from hierarchical structures toward network structures
–	Procurement departments being given new tools to negotiate and possibly form strategic alliances
•	Supply Web is replacing the term “supply chain”
–	Parallel lines interconnect to form a Web or network configuration made up of strategic alliance
•	Roots of Web technology for B2B transactions lie in a hierarchically structured approach to inter-firm information transfer: electronic data exchange
 
Electronic Data Interchange

•	Computer-to-computer business information transfer using a standard format
–	Businesses exchanging info are trading partners
•	EDI compatible firms exchange data in specific standard formats
–	Often transaction data but can include other information related to transactions e.g., price quotes and order status inquiries
•	Most B2B e-commerce adapted from EDI or based on EDI principles
•	Dominant technology for electronic B2B transactions	
 
Early Business Information Interchange Efforts
•	The need to create formal business transaction records began in the late 1800s and early 1900s
•	Companies were using computers for recording internal transactions by the 1950s
–	Information flows between companies still on paper which was
slow, inefficient, redundant and unreliable
•	In the 1960s businesses with volume transactions exchanged info on punched cards or magnetic tape
–	In the 1960s and 1970s technologies improved and intercompany information could be transferred over telephone lines
 
Early Business Information Interchange Efforts (cont’d.)
•	Although these information transfer agreements between trading partners increased efficiency but not ideal
–	Incompatible data translation limited participation
•	Freight and shipping companies joined together in 1968 to create a standardized information set
–	Used a computer file transmittable to any freight company adopting the standard
–	Benefits limited to members of industries that created standard- setting groups
•	Full realization of EDI economies and efficiencies required standards for all companies in all industries
 
Emergence of Broader Standards: The Birth of EDI
•	American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is the
coordinating body for standards in the U.S.
–	Accredited Standards Committee X12 (ASC X12) develops and maintains EDI standards
–	Data Interchange Standards Association (DISA) is the administrative body
coordinating ASC X12 activities
•	The ASC X12 standard currently includes specifications for several hundred transaction sets, which are the names of the formats for specific business data interchanges
•	In 1987, the United Nations published its first standards under the title EDI for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (EDIFACT, or UN/EDIFACT)
 
 


FIGURE 5-4 Commonly used EDI transaction sets
 
How EDI Works

•	Basic idea: straightforward
•	Implementation: complicated
•	Example:
–	Company replacing metal-cutting machine
•	Example 1: Steps to purchase using paper-based system
•	Example 2: Steps to purchase using EDI
 
Paper-Based Purchasing Process

•	Buyer and vendor not using integrated software for business processes so each information processing step results in paper document
•	Must be delivered to department handling next step
–	Paper-based information transfer
•	Mail, courier, fax
–	Information flows shown in Figure 5-5
 



 






























 
EDI Purchasing Process

•	Mail service replaced with EDI network data communications
–	Paper flows within buyer’s and vendor’s organizations replaced with computers running EDI translation software
–	Information flows shown in Figure 5-6
–	Comparisons:
–	Same information is being provided to each department
–	Increase the efficiency and accuracy of business data exchange
–	Shorten the overall purchase process



 




 






























 
Value-Added Networks

•	Trading partners can implement the EDI network and EDI translation processes in several ways
•	Each way uses one of two basic approaches
•	Direct connection EDI requires each business to operate its own on-site EDI translator computer
–	Connected directly to each other using leased telecommunication lines (as shown in Figure 5-6)
–	Few companies use direct connection EDI because dedicated leased lines are expensive
 
 

FIGURE 5-7 Direct connection EDI
 
Value-Added Networks (cont’d.)

•	Company may use the services of a value-added network (VAN)
–	A company that provides communication equipment, software, and skills needed to receives, stores, forwards electronic messages containing EDI transaction sets
•	With indirect connection EDI trading partners use VAN to retrieve EDI-formatted messages
–	Must install compatible EDI translator software
–	Trading partners pass messages through the VAN instead of
directly connecting computers
 
 

FIGURE 5-8 Indirect connection EDI through a VAN
 
Value-Added Networks (cont’d.)

•	Advantages of a VAN
–	Users need to support only the VAN’s one communications protocol instead
of many possible protocols used by trading partners
–	The VAN can provide translation between different transaction sets used by trading partners (for example, the VAN can translate an ASC X12 set into a UN/EDIFACT set)
–	The VAN can perform automatic compliance checking to ensure that the transaction set is in the specified EDI format
–	The VAN records message activity in an audit log. This VAN audit log becomes an independent record of transactions; this record can be helpful
•	Cost used to be a disadvantage, now much lower
–	Internet presents low-cost communications medium used by VAN services
 
Value-Added Networks (cont’d.)

•	EDI on the Internet called Internet EDI, Web EDI, or open EDI
–	Internet is open architect network
•	EDIINT (Electronic Data Interchange-Internet Integration, EDI-INT) is the most common protocol for Internet EDI transaction sets
•	EDI exchanges are encoded using AS2 (Applicability Statement 2) or AS3 (Applicability Statement 3)
–	Both AS2 and AS3 transmissions return secure electronic receipts to the senders for every transaction, which helps establish nonrepudiation
 
EDI Payments

•	EDI transaction sets provide instructions to trading
partner’s bank
•	Negotiable instruments, the electronic equivalent of checks
•	Electronic funds transfers (EFTs) is the movement of money from one bank account to another
–	Executed using an Automated clearing house (ACH) system which is used by service banks to manage accounts with each other
•	Operated by U.S. Federal Reserve Banks, private ACHs
 
Supply Chain Management Using Internet Technologies
•	Supply chain management is the job of managing integration of company supply management and logistics activities
–	Across multiple participants in a particular product’s supply
chain
–	Ultimate goal is to achieve higher-quality or lower-cost product at the end of the chain
 



 


FIGURE 5-9 Advantages of using Internet technologies in supply chain management
 
Cost of Supply Chain

•	The only major disadvantage of using Internet technologies in supply chain management is the cost of those technologies.
•	For most companies, however, the advantages provide much greater value than the costs of implementing and maintaining the technologies.
 
Materials-Tracking  Technologies

•	It is Challenging to track materials as they move from one company
to another or within a company
•	Optical scanners and bar codes can be used to help track movement of materials
•	Integration of bar coding and EDI is now prevalent
–	Manages inventory flows and forecasts materials needs across the supply chain
–	Real-time location systems (RTLS) use bar codes to monitor inventory movements and ensure that goods are shipped as quickly as possible
•	Second wave of electronic commerce includes new types of tracking integrated with Internet-based materials-tracking systems
•	The most promising technology now being used: RFID
 
 
FIGURE 5-10 Shipping label with bar-coded elements from EDI
transaction set 856, Advance Ship Notification
 
Materials-Tracking  Technologies
(cont’d.)

•	Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs)
–	Small chips that use radio transmissions to track inventory
–	Quicker and more accurate than bar codes
–	Active RFIDs have their own power supply
–	Passive RFID tags are inexpensive and small and do NOT
need a power source
–	Goal is to manage inventory better and reduce the incidence of stockouts
 
Materials-Tracking  Technologies
(cont’d.)

•	Bar code MUST be visible to read
•	Neither of active RFID and passive RFID should be visible to read
•	Industry observers believe RFID tagging in retail will become widespread starting in 2017 when many retailers plans to have them in all locations
 
 
FIGURE 5-11 Passive RFID Tag
 

 

FIGURE 5-12 Key features of bar code, passive RFID, and active RFID technologies
 
Building and Maintaining Trust in the Supply Chain
•	Major issue in forming supply chain alliances is developing trust
•	Key elements are continual communication and information sharing
•	Internet and the Web provide excellent ways to communicate and share information and offer new avenues for building trust
–	Provides easy, inexpensive contact with customers
–	Gives buyers instant access to sales representatives
–	Provides comprehensive information quickly
 






CHAPTER SIX
Social Networking, Mobile Commerce, and Online Auctions
 
Introduction

•	Case study: Starbucks
–	Views social media as an extension of the customer relationship
–	Integrates mobile technology by accepting payments from mobile phones
–	Provides mobile device app to let customers manage loyalty program benefits
–	Serves as a social media observer rather than actively advertising
 
From Virtual Communities to Social Networks
•	Online Web communities are by geography
–	Individuals and companies with common interests meet online and discuss issues, share information, generate ideas, and develop valuable relationships
•	Companies make money by serving as relationship facilitators
–	Combine Internet’s transaction cost-reduction potential with a communication facilitator role
 
Virtual Communities

•	Virtual	community	is  a	gathering	place	for	people	and
businesses with no physical existence
•	Began online even before the Internet was in use
–	Bulletin board systems (BBSs) allowed users to connect via phone
lines to read and post messages
•	Mostly free, but some charged a fee
–	Usenet newsgroups were a similar form of virtual community
– Were	message	posting	areas	on	a	set	of	interconnected
computers devoted to storing information on specific topics
•	Substantial	social	interaction	with	communication	and relationships similar to physical communities
 
Early Web Communities

•	1985: WELL (“whole earth ‘lectronic link” predates the Web)
–	Bought by Salon.com in 1999 and continues to operate as a monthly subscription service
•	1995: Beverly Hills Internet opened a virtual community site
–	Offered webcams, free Web site space and links
–	Grew into GeoCities and purchased by Yahoo! in 1999 for $5 billion but closed in 2009
•	1995-2001: Other companies offered similar advertising- supported virtual communities
•	These early communities evolved into social networking
	sites that emerged in the late 1990s	
 
Social Networking Emerges

•	As the Internet and Web grew, many communities found their purpose as a place to share online communication began to fade
•	Instead of a single bond of using the Internet, users finding a variety of common interests for interaction
•	Social networking sites allow individuals to:
–	Create and publish a profile and a list of other users with whom they share a connection (or connections)
–	Control the list and monitor similar lists made by other users



 
Social Networking Emerges
(cont’d.)

•	Early social networking sites included Six Degrees (1997), Friendster (2002), Tribe.net and MySpace
•	Facebook emerged in 2006 and overtook MySpace as the leading social network site worldwide
–	More than a billion users and $6 billion in revenues
•	Other sites include Google+, GREE (Japan), and Renren and QQ (China)
•	LinkedIn dedicated to facilitating business contacts
•	Twitter allows users send short messages (tweets) to other
  users who sign up to follow their messages	
 
Social Networking Emerges
(cont’d.)
•	Basic idea behind many social networking sites is that people are invited to join by existing members
–	Site provides directory (without contact information)
–	Communication does not occur until intended recipient approves the contact
•	Some social networks focused around specific interests or capabilities
–	Flickr, Pinterest, Instagram, CafeMom, Snapchat
•	The expansion of social networking sites into all corners of the world with successful sites in local languages
	emerging in many countries	
 




 






FIGURE 6-1 Social networking Web sites
 
 

FIGURE 6-2 Leading social networking sites around the world
 
Web Logs (Blogs), Microblogs and Participatory Journalism
•	Web sites containing individual commentary on current events or specific issues
–	Form of social networking site
•	Twitter is a very informal microblog with tweets limited to 140 characters
•	Early blogs focused on technology topics or topics on which people had strong beliefs
•	The 2004 election saw blogs used as a political networking tool
–	Communicating messages, organizing volunteers, raising
	money, meetups	
 
Web Logs (Blogs), Microblogs and Participatory Journalism (cont’d.)
•	Based on success of social media, retailers embraced blogs to engage visitors not ready to buy
–	Marketing and supply managers saw social networking benefits of enhancing B2B relationships
•	Participatory journalism is the trend towards having readers help write their own news
•	Blogs can become businesses in themselves if they can generate financial support through fees or advertising
 
Location-Aware Mobile Social Networks
•	Traveling Internet connection opens up social media possibilities that integrate with a user’s specific location
–	Mobile devices transmit their location to Web sites
–	Sites use location information to provide customized advertising and other services
•	In 2015, about 35% of social media users tagged their posts with location info and 82% of mobile users obtained directions or other location information
•	Examples: Foursquare, Facebook, Google+
 
Business Uses of Social Networking
•	Businesses criticized for using social media interactions into thinly-disguised advertising
•	Experts agree social media should be managed differently than advertising efforts
– Managed effectively, social media engagement can provide much more info about customers
•	Brooks Running contributes to social media discussions dedicated to fitness and does not sell products directly
•	Campbell’s Soup discussion areas focusing on what soup can do for the family
 
 
	Figure 6-3 Social media strategies for business	
 
Revenue Models for Social Networking Sites
•	Late 1990s revenue created by selling advertising
–	Used by virtual communities, search engine sites, Web directories
•	In 1998 a wave of purchases and mergers occurred
–	New sites used advertising-only revenue model
•	Included features offered by virtual community sites, search engine sites, Web directories, other information- providing and entertainment sites
–	Web portal goal: every Web user’s doorway to Web
 









 




Figure 6-4 Popularity of leading Web sites
 
Advertising-Supported Social Networking Sites

•	Visitors spend a greater amount of time at portal sites than they do at most other types of Web sites, which is attractive to advertisers.
•	Other types of social networking sites also draw visitors who spend considerable time at the site
–	Smaller sites with specialized appeal can draw enough visitors to generate significant advertising revenue
–	Example: “I Can Has Cheezburger” site
 



 
Figure 6-5 Worldwide social network spending, recent years and projects (in millions of U.S. dollars)
 
Mixed-Revenue and Fee-For- Service Social Networking Sites
•	Most social networking sites use advertising but some charge a fee for some services
–	Examples: Yahoo! All-Star Games package, Yahoo! premium e-mail service
•	Monetizing is converting site visitors into fee-paying subscribers or purchasers of services
–	Concern: visitor backlash
•	Examples of sites that used a mixed-revenue model are the financial information sites The Motley Fool and TheStreet.com
 
Fee-Based Social Networking

•	Google Answers site was an early attempt to monetize social networking by charging a fee for a specific service – Questions answered for a fee from 2002 to 2006
•	Similar free services such as Yahoo! Answers, Amazon (Askville) generate advertising revenue
•	Uclue (paid researchers earn 75% of total fee)
–	Advocates claim better quality of questions and answers
•	Both approaches show how Web sites can generate revenue by providing virtual community interaction
 
Microlending Sites

•	Function as clearinghouses for microlending activity
•	Microlending is lending small amounts of money to people starting or operating small businesses (especially in developing countries)
•	Key element is working within a social network of borrowers who support each other, and an element of pressure to repay
–	Examples: Kiva andMicroPlace
•	Business start-ups in prosperous economies are now using this technique
 
Crowdfunding Sites

•	Small businesses can sell partial ownership in ventures to
investors around the world
•	Social networking sites that provide exactly this opportunity, called
crowdfunding
–	Examples: Kickstarter, IndieGoGo
•	Relies on many people investing a small amount
–	Reduces risk to individual investors while providing substantial equity for new ventures
•	Reward-based crowdfunding investors pay in advance for products and services to be delivered after they are made with invested funds
–	Used by artists and charitable organizations to help complete a specific project
 
Internal Social Networking

•	Provide social interaction among organization’s
employees
•	Also includes important information for employees
•	Run on organization’s intranet
•	Saves money by replacing printed distribution
•	Provided easy access to employee information
•	Good for geographically dispersed employees
•	Many companies are now adding wireless connectivity for employees who are traveling
 
Mobile Commerce

•	Short messaging service (SMS) is usually called texting and allows mobile phone users to send short text messages to each other
•	United States developments allowing phones to be used as Web browsers occurred in 2008
–	High-speed mobile telephone network availability grew dramatically
–	Manufacturers offered range of smart phones with Web browser, large screens, operating system, ability to run applications
•	Potential for mobile commerce (m-commerce)
 
Mobile Phones

•	Internet-capable phones first caught on in Japan and Southeast Asia
–	Telecommunication companies there offered high-capacity mobile phone networks before U.S.
–	NTT DoCoMo, Japan’s largest phone company,
pioneered mobile commerce in 2000
•	In the U.S. the introduction of smart phones and high- capacity networks began appearing in 2008
–	Apple iPhone and Android phones opened the door
for serious U.S. mobile commerce for the first time
 
Tablet Devices

•	Smaller than laptop computer, larger than phone
•	Connect to the Internet wirelessly through phone carrier service or local network
•	Phablets: large phones with high-resolution screens
–	By 2015 more tablets sold than personal computers
•	Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) allows HTML Web pages to be displayed on small-screen devices
–	Has become optional due to larger, high resolution screens
and phablets where normal pages can be displayed
•	Touchscreen controls now prevalent

Auction Basics

•	Auctions date from Babylon in 500 B.C.
•	Common activity in 17th century England
•	Seller offers item for sale and provides information to potential buyers, but does not establish a price
–	Potential buyers (bidders) offer the price they are willing to pay (bids)
–	Private valuations are the amounts buyers are willing to pay
•	Auctioneer manages auction process
–	Shill bidders make bids on behalf of the seller and may artificially inflate the price
 
English Auctions

•	English auctions: bidders publicly announce successively higher bids until no higher bid is forthcoming
–	Item sold to highest bidder (at bidder’s price)
•	Called ascending-price auction, open auction or open-outcry auction as bids are publicly announced
•	Minimum bid is the beginning price
–	If no bidders willing to pay, item is not sold
•	Reserve price is seller’s minimum price
–	If not met, item is not sold
 
Dutch Auctions

•	Dutch auctions: a form of open auction where bidding starts at a
high price and drops until bidder accepts price
•	Also called descending-price auctions
•	Seller offers a number of similar items for sale
•	One common implementation of a Dutch auction uses a clock
that drops the price with each tick
–	First bidders to stop the clock becomes the winning bidder
–	The winning bidder can take all or any part of the auctioned items at that price and if items remain, the clock is restarted
•	Often better for the seller because buyer will not let bid drop much below valuation for fear of losing
 
First-Price Sealed Bid Auctions

•	Sealed-bid auction bidders submit bids independently
•	Are usually prohibited from sharing information with each other
•	First-price sealed-bid auction: the highest bidder wins
–	If multiple items auctioned, next highest bidders awarded remaining items at their bid price
 
Second-Price  Sealed-Bid  Auctions

•	Second-price sealed-bid auction is the same as first-price sealed-bid auction except that the highest bidder is awarded item at the price bid by the second-highest bidder
–	Commonly called Vickrey auctions
•	Yields higher seller returns
•	Encourages bidders to bid private valuation amounts
•	Reduces tendency for bidder collusion
 
Open-Outcry Double Auctions / Double Auctions
•	Open-outcry double auctions
–	Buy and sell offers shouted by traders in trading pit
•	Each commodity, stock option traded in own pit which can become quite frenzied
•	Double auction: buyer and sellers each submit combined price-quantity bids to auctioneer
–	Either sealed-bid or open-outcry
–	Auctioneer matches offers (starting with the lowest seller’s offer and highest buyer’s offer)
–	Used by New York Stock Exchange but now mostly via an electronic
system
 
Reverse (Seller-Bid) Auctions

•	Multiple sellers submit price bids to an auctioneer who represents single buyer
–	Bids for given amount of specific item to purchase
–	Prices go down as bidding continues until no seller willing to bid lower
–	Most involve businesses as buyers and sellers
•	In many business reverse auctions, buyer acts as auctioneer and screens sellers before they can participate
