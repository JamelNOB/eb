above the poverty line
–	Cost-effective for businesses
–	Builds worker knowledge and skills in less developed countries and gives low-income workers in developed countries similar opportunities
–	Use of the Internet to do good around the world
 
Outsourcing and Offshoring

•	Outsourcing is using other organizations to perform specific activities
–	Traditionally used for manufacturing
–	Internet enabled many nonmanufacturing activities being outsourced
•	Offshoring is outsourcing done by organizations in other countries
–	Business process offshoring includes purchasing, research and development, record keeping, information management
–	Impact sourcing (smart sourcing) is offshoring done by or through not-for-profit organizations
 
Purchasing Activities

•	Including identifying and evaluating vendors, selecting specific products, placing orders, resolving any issues after receipt of goods or services
•	Supply chain is the part of industry value chain preceding a particular strategic business unit
–	Includes all activities undertaken by every predecessor in the value chain to design, produce, promote, market, deliver, support each individual component of a product or service
•	Traditionally purchasing department buys components at lowest price possible via bidding
 
Purchasing Activities (cont’d.)

•	Procurement includes all purchasing activities, monitoring all purchase transaction elements and managing and developing supplier relationships
–	Also called supply management
•	Procurement staff have high product knowledge to identify and evaluate appropriate suppliers
–	Sourcing is identifying suppliers and determining qualifications
–	e-sourcing is the use of Internet technologies in
sourcing activities
 
Purchasing Activities (cont’d.)

•	Business purchasing process is more complex than most consumer purchasing processes
•	Spend is the total yearly dollar amount for goods and services purchased
–	Managing spend is an important function and can be a key component in overall profitability

business purchasing process









CHAPTER 5: Business-to-Business Activities	7
 
Direct vs. Indirect Materials Purchasing
•	Direct materials are those materials that become part of the finished product in a manufacturing process. E.g., iron ore for Steel manufacturer
•	Direct materials purchasing
•	Replenishment purchasing (contract purchasing)
•	Company negotiates long-term material contracts
•	Spot purchasing
•	Purchases made in loosely organized (spot) market
•	If demand exceeds contract purchasing estimates
•	Indirect materials are all other materials company purchases
•	Includes factory supplies such as sandpaper, hand tools and replacement parts for machinery
 
Logistics Activities

•	Classic objective is to provide the right goods in the right quantities in the right place at the right time
•	Managing materials, supplies and finished goods
–	Web and the Internet providing increasing number of opportunities to better manage activities
–	Lower transaction costs and constant connectivity between firms
•	Marriage of GPS and portable computing with the Internet is an example of second-wave e-commerce
•	Third-wave e-commerce supported by smart phones
 
Business Process Support Activities

•	Supporting activities including: finance and administration, human resources (HR), technology development
–	Human resources, payroll, retirement plan servicing often outsourced by small/midsized companies
•	Common support activity is training
–	May be handled by HR or individual departments
 
 


FIGURE 5-2 Categories of support activities
 
E-Government

•	Use of Internet technologies by governments and government agencies
–	Enhances functions performed for stakeholders and businesslike activity operations
–	U.S. government Financial Management Service (FMS)
uses Pay.gov to handle activity
–	Bureau of Public Debt: TreasuryDirect site
–	Also used in other countries
•	U.S. states and cities usually have sites
–	Information about laws and regulations, licenses, jobs, tourism and more

Network Model of Economic Organization in Purchasing: Supply Webs

•	Trend in purchasing, logistics, and support activities is the shift from hierarchical structures toward network structures
–	Procurement departments being given new tools to negotiate and possibly form strategic alliances
•	Supply Web is replacing the term “supply chain”
–	Parallel lines interconnect to form a Web or network configuration made up of strategic alliance
•	Roots of Web technology for B2B transactions lie in a hierarchically structured approach to inter-firm information transfer: electronic data exchange
 
Electronic Data Interchange

•	Computer-to-computer business information transfer using a standard format
–	Businesses exchanging info are trading partners
•	EDI compatible firms exchange data in specific standard formats
–	Often transaction data but can include other information related to transactions e.g., price quotes and order status inquiries
•	Most B2B e-commerce adapted from EDI or based on EDI principles
•	Dominant technology for electronic B2B transactions	
 
Early Business Information Interchange Efforts
•	The need to create formal business transaction records began in the late 1800s and early 1900s
•	Companies were using computers for recording internal transactions by the 1950s
–	Information flows between companies still on paper which was
slow, inefficient, redundant and unreliable
•	In the 1960s businesses with volume transactions exchanged info on punched cards or magnetic tape
–	In the 1960s and 1970s technologies improved and intercompany information could be transferred over telephone lines
 
Early Business Information Interchange Efforts (cont’d.)
•	Although these information transfer agreements between trading partners increased efficiency but not ideal
–	Incompatible data translation limited participation
•	Freight and shipping companies joined together in 1968 to create a standardized information set
–	Used a computer file transmittable to any freight company adopting the standard
–	Benefits limited to members of industries that created standard- setting groups
•	Full realization of EDI economies and efficiencies required standards for all companies in all industries
 
Emergence of Broader Standards: The Birth of EDI
•	American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is the
coordinating body for standards in the U.S.
–	Accredited Standards Committee X12 (ASC X12) develops and maintains EDI standards
–	Data Interchange Standards Association (DISA) is the administrative body
coordinating ASC X12 activities
•	The ASC X12 standard currently includes specifications for several hundred transaction sets, which are the names of the formats for specific business data interchanges
•	In 1987, the United Nations published its first standards under the title EDI for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (EDIFACT, or UN/EDIFACT)
 
 


FIGURE 5-4 Commonly used EDI transaction sets
 
How EDI Works

•	Basic idea: straightforward
•	Implementation: complicated
•	Example:
–	Company replacing metal-cutting machine
•	Example 1: Steps to purchase using paper-based system
•	Example 2: Steps to purchase using EDI
 
Paper-Based Purchasing Process

•	Buyer and vendor not using integrated software for business processes so each information processing step results in paper document
•	Must be delivered to department handling next step
–	Paper-based information transfer
•	Mail, courier, fax
–	Information flows shown in Figure 5-5
 



 






























 
EDI Purchasing Process

•	Mail service replaced with EDI network data communications
–	Paper flows within buyer’s and vendor’s organizations replaced with computers running EDI translation software
–	Information flows shown in Figure 5-6
–	Comparisons:
–	Same information is being provided to each department
–	Increase the efficiency and accuracy of business data exchange
–	Shorten the overall purchase process



 




 






























 
Value-Added Networks

•	Trading partners can implement the EDI network and EDI translation processes in several ways
•	Each way uses one of two basic approaches
•	Direct connection EDI requires each business to operate its own on-site EDI translator computer
–	Connected directly to each other using leased telecommunication lines (as shown in Figure 5-6)
–	Few companies use direct connection EDI because dedicated leased lines are expensive
 
 

FIGURE 5-7 Direct connection EDI
 
Value-Added Networks (cont’d.)

•	Company may use the services of a value-added network (VAN)
–	A company that provides communication equipment, software, and skills needed to receives, stores, forwards electronic messages containing EDI transaction sets
•	With indirect connection EDI trading partners use VAN to retrieve EDI-formatted messages
–	Must install compatible EDI translator software
–	Trading partners pass messages through the VAN instead of
directly connecting computers
 
 

FIGURE 5-8 Indirect connection EDI through a VAN
 
Value-Added Networks (cont’d.)

•	Advantages of a VAN
–	Users need to support only the VAN’s one communications protocol instead
of many possible protocols used by trading partners
–	The VAN can provide translation between different transaction sets used by trading partners (for example, the VAN can translate an ASC X12 set into a UN/EDIFACT set)
–	The VAN can perform automatic compliance checking to ensure that the transaction set is in the specified EDI format
–	The VAN records message activity in an audit log. This VAN audit log becomes an independent record of transactions; this record can be helpful
•	Cost used to be a disadvantage, now much lower
–	Internet presents low-cost communications medium used by VAN services
 
Value-Added Networks (cont’d.)

•	EDI on the Internet called Internet EDI, Web EDI, or open EDI
–	Internet is open architect network
•	EDIINT (Electronic Data Interchange-Internet Integration, EDI-INT) is the most common protocol for Internet EDI transaction sets
•	EDI exchanges are encoded using AS2 (Applicability Statement 2) or AS3 (Applicability Statement 3)
–	Both AS2 and AS3 transmissions return secure electronic receipts to the senders for every transaction, which helps establish nonrepudiation
 
EDI Payments

•	EDI transaction sets provide instructions to trading
partner’s bank
•	Negotiable instruments, the electronic equivalent of checks
•	Electronic funds transfers (EFTs) is the movement of money from one bank account to another
–	Executed using an Automated clearing house (ACH) system which is used by service banks to manage accounts with each other
•	Operated by U.S. Federal Reserve Banks, private ACHs
 
Supply Chain Management Using Internet Technologies
•	Supply chain management is the job of managing integration of company supply management and logistics activities
–	Across multiple participants in a particular product’s supply
chain
–	Ultimate goal is to achieve higher-quality or lower-cost product at the end of the chain
 



 


FIGURE 5-9 Advantages of using Internet technologies in supply chain management
 
Cost of Supply Chain

•	The only major disadvantage of using Internet technologies in supply chain management is the cost of those technologies.
•	For most companies, however, the advantages provide much greater value than the costs of implementing and maintaining the technologies.
 
Materials-Tracking  Technologies

•	It is Challenging to track materials as they move from one company
to another or within a company
•	Optical scanners and bar codes can be used to help track movement of materials
•	Integration of bar coding and EDI is now prevalent
–	Manages inventory flows and forecasts materials needs across the supply chain
–	Real-time location systems (RTLS) use bar codes to monitor inventory movements and ensure that goods are shipped as quickly as possible
•	Second wave of electronic commerce includes new types of tracking integrated with Internet-based materials-tracking systems
•	The most promising technology now being used: RFID
 
 
FIGURE 5-10 Shipping label with bar-coded elements from EDI
transaction set 856, Advance Ship Notification
 
Materials-Tracking  Technologies
(cont’d.)

•	Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs)
–	Small chips that use radio transmissions to track inventory
–	Quicker and more accurate than bar codes
–	Active RFIDs have their own power supply
–	Passive RFID tags are inexpensive and small and do NOT
need a power source
–	Goal is to manage inventory better and reduce the incidence of stockouts
 
Materials-Tracking  Technologies
(cont’d.)

•	Bar code MUST be visible to read
•	Neither of active RFID and passive RFID should be visible to read
•	Industry observers believe RFID tagging in retail will become widespread starting in 2017 when many retailers plans to have them in all locations
 
 
FIGURE 5-11 Passive RFID Tag
 

 

FIGURE 5-12 Key features of bar code, passive RFID, and active RFID technologies
 
Building and Maintaining Trust in the Supply Chain
•	Major issue in forming supply chain alliances is developing trust
•	Key elements are continual communication and information sharing
•	Internet and the Web provide excellent ways to communicate and share information and offer new avenues for building trust
–	Provides easy, inexpensive contact with customers
–	Gives buyers instant access to sales representatives
–	Provides comprehensive information quickly
 






CHAPTER SIX
Social Networking, Mobile Commerce, and Online Auctions
 
Introduction

•	Case study: Starbucks
–	Views social media as an extension of the customer relationship
–	Integrates mobile technology by accepting payments from mobile phones
–	Provides mobile device app to let customers manage loyalty program benefits
–	Serves as a social media observer rather than actively advertising
 
From Virtual Communities to Social Networks
•	Online Web communities are by geography
–	Individuals and companies with common interests meet online and discuss issues, share information, generate ideas, and develop valuable relationships
•	Companies make money by serving as relationship facilitators
–	Combine Internet’s transaction cost-reduction potential with a communication facilitator role
 
Virtual Communities

•	Virtual	community	is  a	gathering	place	for	people	and
businesses with no physical existence
•	Began online even before the Internet was in use
–	Bulletin board systems (BBSs) allowed users to connect via phone
lines to read and post messages
•	Mostly free, but some charged a fee
–	Usenet newsgroups were a similar form of virtual community
– Were	message	posting	areas	on	a	set	of	interconnected
computers devoted to storing information on specific topics
•	Substantial	social	interaction	with	communication	and relationships similar to physical communities
 
Early Web Communities

•	1985: WELL (“whole earth ‘lectronic link” predates the Web)
–	Bought by Salon.com in 1999 and continues to operate as a monthly subscription service
•	1995: Beverly Hills Internet opened a virtual community site
–	Offered webcams, free Web site space and links
–	Grew into GeoCities and purchased by Yahoo! in 1999 for $5 billion but closed in 2009
•	1995-2001: Other companies offered similar advertising- supported virtual communities
•	These early communities evolved into social networking
	sites that emerged in the late 1990s	
 
Social Networking Emerges

•	As the Internet and Web grew, many communities found their purpose as a place to share online communication began to fade
•	Instead of a single bond of using the Internet, users finding a variety of common interests for interaction
•	Social networking sites allow individuals to:
–	Create and publish a profile and a list of other users with whom they share a connection (or connections)
–	Control the list and monitor similar lists made by other users



 
Social Networking Emerges
(cont’d.)

•	Early social networking sites included Six Degrees (1997), Friendster (2002), Tribe.net and MySpace
•	Facebook emerged in 2006 and overtook MySpace as the leading social network site worldwide
–	More than a billion users and $6 billion in revenues
•	Other sites include Google+, GREE (Japan), and Renren and QQ (China)
•	LinkedIn dedicated to facilitating business contacts
•	Twitter allows users send short messages (tweets) to other
  users who sign up to follow their messages	
 
Social Networking Emerges
(cont’d.)
•	Basic idea behind many social networking sites is that people are invited to join by existing members
–	Site provides directory (without contact information)
–	Communication does not occur until intended recipient approves the contact
•	Some social networks focused around specific interests or capabilities
–	Flickr, Pinterest, Instagram, CafeMom, Snapchat
•	The expansion of social networking sites into all corners of the world with successful sites in local languages
	emerging in many countries	
 




 






FIGURE 6-1 Social networking Web sites
 
 

FIGURE 6-2 Leading social networking sites around the world
 
Web Logs (Blogs), Microblogs and Participatory Journalism
•	Web sites containing individual commentary on current events or specific issues
–	Form of social networking site
•	Twitter is a very informal microblog with tweets limited to 140 characters
•	Early blogs focused on technology topics or topics on which people had strong beliefs
•	The 2004 election saw blogs used as a political networking tool
–	Communicating messages, organizing volunteers, raising
	money, meetups	
 
Web Logs (Blogs), Microblogs and Participatory Journalism (cont’d.)
•	Based on success of social media, retailers embraced blogs to engage visitors not ready to buy
–	Marketing and supply managers saw social networking benefits of enhancing B2B relationships
•	Participatory journalism is the trend towards having readers help write their own news
•	Blogs can become businesses in themselves if they can generate financial support through fees or advertising
 
Location-Aware Mobile Social Networks
•	Traveling Internet connection opens up social media possibilities that integrate with a user’s specific location
–	Mobile devices transmit their location to Web sites
–	Sites use location information to provide customized advertising and other services
•	In 2015, about 35% of social media users tagged their posts with location info and 82% of mobile users obtained directions or other location information
•	Examples: Foursquare, Facebook, Google+
 
Business Uses of Social Networking
•	Businesses criticized for using social media interactions into thinly-disguised advertising
•	Experts agree social media should be managed differently than advertising efforts
– Managed effectively, social media engagement can provide much more info about customers
•	Brooks Running contributes to social media discussions dedicated to fitness and does not sell products directly
•	Campbell’s Soup discussion areas focusing on what soup can do for the family
 
 
	Figure 6-3 Social media strategies for business	
 
Revenue Models for Social Networking Sites
•	Late 1990s revenue created by selling advertising
–	Used by virtual communities, search engine sites, Web directories
•	In 1998 a wave of purchases and mergers occurred
–	New sites used advertising-only revenue model
•	Included features offered by virtual community sites, search engine sites, Web directories, other information- providing and entertainment sites
–	Web portal goal: every Web user’s doorway to Web
 









 




Figure 6-4 Popularity of leading Web sites
 
Advertising-Supported Social Networking Sites

•	Visitors spend a greater amount of time at portal sites than they do at most other types of Web sites, which is attractive to advertisers.
•	Other types of social networking sites also draw visitors who spend considerable time at the site
–	Smaller sites with specialized appeal can draw enough visitors to generate significant advertising revenue
–	Example: “I Can Has Cheezburger” site
 



 
Figure 6-5 Worldwide social network spending, recent years and projects (in millions of U.S. dollars)
 
Mixed-Revenue and Fee-For- Service Social Networking Sites
•	Most social networking sites use advertising but some charge a fee for some services
–	Examples: Yahoo! All-Star Games package, Yahoo! premium e-mail service
•	Monetizing is converting site visitors into fee-paying subscribers or purchasers of services
–	Concern: visitor backlash
•	Examples of sites that used a mixed-revenue model are the financial information sites The Motley Fool and TheStreet.com
 
Fee-Based Social Networking

•	Google Answers site was an early attempt to monetize social networking by charging a fee for a specific service – Questions answered for a fee from 2002 to 2006
•	Similar free services such as Yahoo! Answers, Amazon (Askville) generate advertising revenue
•	Uclue (paid researchers earn 75% of total fee)
–	Advocates claim better quality of questions and answers
•	Both approaches show how Web sites can generate revenue by providing virtual community interaction
 
Microlending Sites

•	Function as clearinghouses for microlending activity
•	Microlending is lending small amounts of money to people starting or operating small businesses (especially in developing countries)
•	Key element is working within a social network of borrowers who support each other, and an element of pressure to repay
–	Examples: Kiva andMicroPlace
•	Business start-ups in prosperous economies are now using this technique
 
Crowdfunding Sites

•	Small businesses can sell partial ownership in ventures to
investors around the world
•	Social networking sites that provide exactly this opportunity, called
crowdfunding
–	Examples: Kickstarter, IndieGoGo
•	Relies on many people investing a small amount
–	Reduces risk to individual investors while providing substantial equity for new ventures
•	Reward-based crowdfunding investors pay in advance for products and services to be delivered after they are made with invested funds
–	Used by artists and charitable organizations to help complete a specific project
 
Internal Social Networking

•	Provide social interaction among organization’s
employees
•	Also includes important information for employees
•	Run on organization’s intranet
•	Saves money by replacing printed distribution
•	Provided easy access to employee information
•	Good for geographically dispersed employees
•	Many companies are now adding wireless connectivity for employees who are traveling
 
Mobile Commerce

•	Short messaging service (SMS) is usually called texting and allows mobile phone users to send short text messages to each other
•	United States developments allowing phones to be used as Web browsers occurred in 2008
–	High-speed mobile telephone network availability grew dramatically
–	Manufacturers offered range of smart phones with Web browser, large screens, operating system, ability to run applications
•	Potential for mobile commerce (m-commerce)
 
Mobile Phones

•	Internet-capable phones first caught on in Japan and Southeast Asia
–	Telecommunication companies there offered high-capacity mobile phone networks before U.S.
–	NTT DoCoMo, Japan’s largest phone company,
pioneered mobile commerce in 2000
•	In the U.S. the introduction of smart phones and high- capacity networks began appearing in 2008
–	Apple iPhone and Android phones opened the door
for serious U.S. mobile commerce for the first time
 
Tablet Devices

•	Smaller than laptop computer, larger than phone
•	Connect to the Internet wirelessly through phone carrier service or local network
•	Phablets: large phones with high-resolution screens
–	By 2015 more tablets sold than personal computers
•	Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) allows HTML Web pages to be displayed on small-screen devices
–	Has become optional due to larger, high resolution screens
and phablets where normal pages can be displayed
•	Touchscreen controls now prevalent

Auction Basics

•	Auctions date from Babylon in 500 B.C.
•	Common activity in 17th century England
•	Seller offers item for sale and provides information to potential buyers, but does not establish a price
–	Potential buyers (bidders) offer the price they are willing to pay (bids)
–	Private valuations are the amounts buyers are willing to pay
•	Auctioneer manages auction process
–	Shill bidders make bids on behalf of the seller and may artificially inflate the price
 
English Auctions

•	English auctions: bidders publicly announce successively higher bids until no higher bid is forthcoming
–	Item sold to highest bidder (at bidder’s price)
•	Called ascending-price auction, open auction or open-outcry auction as bids are publicly announced
•	Minimum bid is the beginning price
–	If no bidders willing to pay, item is not sold
•	Reserve price is seller’s minimum price
–	If not met, item is not sold
 
Dutch Auctions

•	Dutch auctions: a form of open auction where bidding starts at a
high price and drops until bidder accepts price
•	Also called descending-price auctions
•	Seller offers a number of similar items for sale
•	One common implementation of a Dutch auction uses a clock
that drops the price with each tick
–	First bidders to stop the clock becomes the winning bidder
–	The winning bidder can take all or any part of the auctioned items at that price and if items remain, the clock is restarted
•	Often better for the seller because buyer will not let bid drop much below valuation for fear of losing
 
First-Price Sealed Bid Auctions

•	Sealed-bid auction bidders submit bids independently
•	Are usually prohibited from sharing information with each other
•	First-price sealed-bid auction: the highest bidder wins
–	If multiple items auctioned, next highest bidders awarded remaining items at their bid price
 
Second-Price  Sealed-Bid  Auctions

•	Second-price sealed-bid auction is the same as first-price sealed-bid auction except that the highest bidder is awarded item at the price bid by the second-highest bidder
–	Commonly called Vickrey auctions
•	Yields higher seller returns
•	Encourages bidders to bid private valuation amounts
•	Reduces tendency for bidder collusion
 
Open-Outcry Double Auctions / Double Auctions
•	Open-outcry double auctions
–	Buy and sell offers shouted by traders in trading pit
•	Each commodity, stock option traded in own pit which can become quite frenzied
•	Double auction: buyer and sellers each submit combined price-quantity bids to auctioneer
–	Either sealed-bid or open-outcry
–	Auctioneer matches offers (starting with the lowest seller’s offer and highest buyer’s offer)
–	Used by New York Stock Exchange but now mostly via an electronic
system
 
Reverse (Seller-Bid) Auctions

•	Multiple sellers submit price bids to an auctioneer who represents single buyer
–	Bids for given amount of specific item to purchase
–	Prices go down as bidding continues until no seller willing to bid lower
–	Most involve businesses as buyers and sellers
•	In many business reverse auctions, buyer acts as auctioneer and screens sellers before they can participate
